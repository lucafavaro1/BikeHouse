## General Information
Development of a web application using MERN stack that implements our business idea of a marketplace of used bike. 
In particular, the web app is based:
- MongoDB for the database
- NodeJS and Express for the backend
- Reacts for the frontend


## Included use cases
- Register and verify your profile
- Sell a bike
- Find a bike
- Buy a bike / accessories


## Setup

After cloning the repo, use the following instructions to run the project.

BACKEND:
In the backend folder, use `npm install` to install all the missing modules.
It may happen that you get this error `Cannot find module @sendgrid/mail`.
In this case, install the package manually with `npm i @sendgrid/mail`.

FRONTEND:
In the frontend folder, use `npm i --force` to install all the missing modules.

## Usage
From two different terminals, run backend and frontend both with `npm start`
